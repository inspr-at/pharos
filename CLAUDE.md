  Doctrine loader.

  This project vendors the PUBLIC INSPR doctrine only — the identity-free
  safety baseline. It deliberately does not carry the operator-specific
  half: no fleet, no tracker layout, no personal preferences. Nothing here
  assumes anyone's infrastructure.

  Source: github.com/inspr-at/inspr-modules, vendored as ./doctrine.
  Bump with: git submodule update --remote doctrine
  Verify:    ./doctrine/scripts/doctrine-check.sh
